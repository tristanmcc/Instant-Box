# Instant-Box
Instant Box is a basic package tracking app made with React. It is fashioned after traditional package tracking services offered by companies like Instabox or DHL

### Project Status

For the purposes of this Sunday night submission, the status of this project is: complete. But if I had more time, I would like to have extended the search functionality. Right now, one can only Search based on the parcel ID, in future I would like to implement a search functionality where by the user can search for packeges by 'sender' and 'status' too. As this was arguably out of the scope of the project brief, I endeavoured to make the project as responsive and 'styled' as I could instead.

# Getting Started with Create React App

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Reflection

The goal of this was to create an application where by a user can check packages they are expecting from this logistics/distribution company. I am satisfied with the results, I think the styling looks good and I believe I have met most if not all of the functionality expectations, though the brief gave little to go on. All in all I would like to implement further 'Search' functionality once SDA is complete.
